# Dev Landing Page

Minimal landing page for developers.

Developers don't talk much. Their code does all the talking. So here's a minimal landing page for developers with 9 themes.

## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

I wanted a minimal landing page to showcase everything I do online. So I sat down one night and created this **Dev Landing Page**. And I think most of the devs out there would want the same. So fellow devs, feel free fork and make this landing page yours.

## Themes

Dev Landing Page comes in 9 **material themes**.

## GitHub Pages

GitHub makes it easy to create personal websites. Follow this link - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to know how or follow the steps below.

If you already have a GitHub profile (obviously)

* Create a new repo with the name `{username}.github.io`
* Clone/Fork this repo and copy the files to your newly created repo
* Customize your name, links and everything else for your landing page
* `git push`

Voila! Your site should be live at `https://{username}.github.io`

My **Dev Landing Page** is in my favourite yellow theme - [Dinesh Pandiyan](https://flexdinesh.github.io)
